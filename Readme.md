# Event Subscription

Integration for that gives users the ability to subscribe to specific events and get notfied then they are complete.

### Features
- Create events users/persons can subscribe to. (Provide default messages for subscribe, unsubscribe and complete)
- Buttons for subscribing, unsubscribing and completeing events + resetting a subscription list
- Services for subscribing, unsubscribing users (dynamic and specific), completeing events and resetting the subscription list

### Prerequisites
This integration has https://github.com/Tabisch/ha-person-notify as a prerequisite. \
If you do fulfill that prerequisite, this integration will not work.

### Note
This integration is very early development, if you can even call it that. \
I just build what i needed for now. \
If you have any ideas or find any bugs, just open an issue.
